Instructions:

1. Open "Anaconda Powershell Prompt (Anaconda 3)" from the Search bar
    This is the command line tool you will work in.
2. Type: cd e:\FisheyeToEquirectangular\
    This will move you to the correct directory.
3. Type: conda activate py36
    This will start python. You should see (py36) replace (base) at start of prompt line.
4. Type: python find.py -i ..\FOOTAGE\ -t "6/26/2019 18:23:00" -c 3 4
    Replace string in quotes with desired timestamp to search.
    Replace 3 4 with camera pair.
5. It will print out two commands, copy and paste either one into the prompt and the process will begin.
    The first command starts from beginning of clip.
    The second command starts from desired timestamp.
    By default, it will export through end of file.
    If you want to export a limited duration add "-d [seconds]" to end of comand.
    For example: "-d 60" would give one minute clip.
6. unwarp process is currently set at slowest/least compressed.
    To see all options you can tweak, type: "python unwarp.py -h"
